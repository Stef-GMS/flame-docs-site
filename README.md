This is a repo to deploy the documentation of Flame to our website.

The documentation is included in the mono-repo and can be browsed via GitHub [here](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/doc).

This repo will generate HTML files for each supported version (and the `main` branch) and publish them [here](https://docs.flame-engine.org).
